# ``react`` Physics

My vision for this project is to make available a high performance and highly flexible physics engine to the Open Source community. I imagine this would have more impact in the academic community, but I would also hope that applications in computer graphics or gaming would not be uncommon =)

### Don't we already have other Open Source physics engines out there?

Yes we do, there are plenty of good general purpose physics engine such as Chipmunk2D, Box2D, Bullet and Newton. However I am doing this more for the experience than to compete with the existing engines, but it is good to have a clear idea where the project should be headed!
